# Analytics in practice

This workshop is dedicated to conveying a sense of how to structure analytic projects systematically, from understanding of the business problem over modeling up to model assessment and communication of the project's results. This workshop introduces a way of such a structure with an applied, step-by-step introduction that mixes theory and practical, hands-on implementation tasks. We will make extensive use of R programming and, for the visualisation part, will gain a working knowledge of Tableau.
